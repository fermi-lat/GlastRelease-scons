/*! @mainpage  package RootDisplay

@author H. Kelly

  Adds 2 menu items in the Gleam GUI to allow the user to set the requested index
  or run/event pair to be read in for the next event.
  Uses the RootIoSvc in RootIo to communicate requested run/event pair or index to RootIo.
  Note that if the requested index or run/event pair are invalid - the menu items will re-appear - requiring the user to make another selection.
  
  TODO: fill this in.

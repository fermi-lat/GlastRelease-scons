<!-- ideal mode calibrations are based on measured means calibrations of real Cal flight models.

They are not well suited to real data as they treat all crystals as equal, using them w/ the varying pedestals in real 
data could cause some calculations to go out of range.

'muon' mode calibrations are simply average values from ground muon collections.

The effective reponse of the current configuration is as follows

NEWIDEAL_MUON2 ( CalXtalReponse v0r2p6, GlastRelease v6r4 -> v6r5)
(all ADC units are pedestal subtracted)

it incoperates the following improvements over the prievous version.

- ULD values for all ranges and HEX1 saturation level are set to very close to 4095.  The previous values were lower in an effort to avoid problems caused by channels w/ higher pedestals which is not an issue in ideal mode
- LAC threshold was raised to 1.3 MeV which is closer to the mean LAC threshold used for flight crystals
- pedestal noise levels are lower to better reflect the true behavior of the flight front-ends
- some values were rounded a bit just to make things simpler.

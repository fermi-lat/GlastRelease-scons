                      DC  try to adapt to new root formats => failure
  v5r22p5em2 13-apr-05 ZF skip don't die on bad xtal response.  initialize loop var.  works with multi tower.
  v5r24   07-apr-05   Pol Introduction of CalTkrLikelihoodTool.
                      DC  Introduction of CalTransvOffsetTool (code extracted from CalClustersAlg).
                      DC  CalClusteringData transformed into CalReconKernel
                      DC  Factorize access to CalReconKernel in CalReconActor
                      DC  Corr tools managed as a list.
                      DC  Removed energy attribute from EnergyCorr.
                      DC  LastLayerTool directly stores its result in cluster.
  v5r23p2 05-apr-05   DC  Energy corrections made optional.
                      DC  Experimental: check the use of algorithm options.
                      DC  Tests independent of TkrRecon.
                      DC  merge v5r22p5em0 and v5r22p5em1 
                      ZF  Windows bug fixes.
  v5r23p1 16-mar-05   DC  improved tests, unified EnergyCorr interface, centralized Clustering data
  v5r22p5em1 25-mar-05 ZF really fixed TKR only bug this time.
  v5r22p5em0 25-mar-05 ZF  fixed bug w/ tkr only data.  updated comments & doc for CalXXtalRecAlg.
  v5r22p5 16-mar-05    ZF  improved verbose print outs, improved performance re: MsgStream ctors
  v5r22p4  2-mar-05    ZF  uses latest CalXtalResponse
  v5r22p3 20-feb-05    THB include CalValsCoorTool update to correct tracker plane numbering.  
  v5r22p2 20-feb-05    THB replace xml with xmlBase, so that xml package can be removed.  
  v5r22p1 18-feb-05    ZF  once again... DOS path had bad case, had to fix for linux
  v5r22   18-feb-05    ZF  differentiate range_below_thresh from xtal_below_thresh; fix math error in calcPos(); only calc one energy & pos estimate per xtal (best range only)

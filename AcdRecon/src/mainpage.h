/** @mainpage package acdRecon
 * @author Heather Kelly
 * @section intro Introduction
 * This package contains the ACD (Anti-Coincidence Detector) reconstruction
 * algorithms.
 * The algorithms are implemented as Gaudi algorithms.
 * The primary output from the ACD reconstruction is the quantities reported
 * in the standard ntuple output.
 * Included among these value are the minimum distance between the reconstructed 
 * tracks and ACD tiles above veto threshold.
 * The ntuple output includes:
 * - ACD_TotEnergy - total energy deposited in all tiles above veto threshold
 * - ACD_TileCount - number of tiles above veto threshold
 *

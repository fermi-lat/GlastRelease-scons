Installation instructions
-------------------------
 + set the environment:
   - G4INSTALL as usual to point to your geant4 installation.
     * [optional] set G4LISTS_BASE, if you have your own physics lists area
       installation point different from the default one. G4LISTS_BASE must
       point to the 'physics_lists' directory that contains the subdirectory
       'hadronic'.
 + type 'make' from physics_lists/hadronic directory
 + to build your own application/example: copy the provided
   GNUmakefile.user.code.example file to your application area and
   uncomment the physics lists you decide to employ.

 NOTE for Linux/Unix users:
   - Shared libraries of the physics-lists are NOT allowed if granular
     kernel libraries of Geant4 are installed and used. In this specific
     case, physics-lists must be built only with -static- libraries,
     (i.e. - must have the variable G4LIB_BUILD_SHARED -unset-) !

 NOTE for Windows users:
   - If DLL libraries of the kernel libraries of Geant4 are installed,
     the physics-lists must be installed using the variable G4LIB_USE_DLL
     -set- (i.e. - use 'make G4LIB_USE_DLL=1' to build the physics-lists).
     Similar for building any Geant4 example or application.

Setting default cut values
--------------------------
 - The default is: defaultCutValue = 0.7*mm;  
 - To override this value, please call the 
  "void SetDefaultCutValue(G4double newCutValue)" method of the Physics List.

Verbosity Level
---------------
 - verbosity level of any Physics List can be established via its
   constructor, e.g. "new QGSP(0)" means 0 verbosity level for
   the Physics List. The default level is 1.

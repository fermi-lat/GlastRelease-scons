## would be nice if we could get away without the "use calibUtil"
## to divorce ourselves from xml and MySQL, but as things stand
## now we can't.  Would need to separate calibUtil into two pieces:
## one simply defining the data and access methods for calib data
## classes, and another for (friend?) classes which would know how to
## fill the data classes.  Then CalibData 
use calibUtil v0r*

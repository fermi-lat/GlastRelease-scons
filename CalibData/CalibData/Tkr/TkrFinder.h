/** @class TkrFinder

   Utility class which knows how to find the index of the
   correct set of TKR calibration constants given id.

   Calibration data is kept in what is logically a 2-dimensional
   array,
   data[iTower,iUniplane]

   Within a unilayer, data may be organized by strip or by fe chip.
   There is also a small amount of per-tower information
   
   The base class keeps an array of 16 pointers to TkrTower
   objects (since there can never be more than 16), initialized
   to 0.  TkrTowers are allocated as needed.  
   
   Note convention for tower numbering follows
   (Ritz, Nordby) LAT-SS-00035-03-D1.  For the standard 4x4 array,
   this yields

                     12   13   14   15  | r3
                                        |
                      8    9   10   11  | r2
                                        |           ^
                      4    5    6    7  | r1        |
                                        |           |
                      0    1    2    3  | r0        
                                        |           Y

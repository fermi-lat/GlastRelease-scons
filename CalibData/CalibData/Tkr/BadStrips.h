/**
         @file CalibData/BadStrips.h

         This file actually defines two public classes in the CalibData
         namespace : BadStrips and BadStripsVisitor.  BadStrips is
         the TCDS form of bad strip (dead or hot but not both) calibration
         information.  BadStripsVisitor is a pure virtual class to be 
         used as a base by applications wishing to access the information 
         in BadStrips.

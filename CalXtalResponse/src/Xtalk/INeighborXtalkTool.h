    \brief Abstract interface class for calculation of electronic crosstalk
    in GLAST Cal originating from neighboring CsI crystal detector element electronics.

	Generally speaking, cross-talk @ any point will depend on a static crosstalk coefficient table & a per-event signal map for the whole cal.
	Tool implementation will then model crosstalk measured @ any particular channel based on these tables.

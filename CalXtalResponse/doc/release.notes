v0r1p1 fixed test_app to work w/ last update (whoops!)
v0r1   differentiated between range_below_thresh & xtal_below_thresh in recon.

v0r0p2 better checking for ADC values which are too low & cause ugly results.
v0r0p1 got it to build w/out errors on linux
v0r0   initial release of CalXtalResponse - uses v3 calibGenCAL calibration to do single crystal response calculation & simulation for both CalRecon & CalDigi

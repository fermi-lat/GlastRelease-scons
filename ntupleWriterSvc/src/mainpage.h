/** @mainpage package ntupleWriterSvc
 * @author Heather Kelly
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * This package is an interface to the Gaudi NTupleSvc.  Our GLAST
 * algorithms use the ntupleWriterSvc to submit entries into the
 * standard GLAST ntuple.
 * For more information see the <a href=../ntupleWriterSvc.htm>manual</a>.

 * <br>(T. Burnett) An additional posibility for ROOT tuples is the service RootTupleSvc. It allows for multiple trees, and has only a setup phase:
 one defines the tuple at initialization time, with pointers to the tuple values. For more information about this, see the 
 <a href=../RootWriterSvc.htm> supplemental manual</a>

                              (includes celestial coordinates for the best OBF track)
                          New Vtx variables related to the second vertex
                          Celestial coordinates for Mc particle
 v2r19p4 05-Mar-07   EAC  Added Doca to Acd tile screw holes, Error on track extrapolation at ACD, MC energy at ACD entry.
 v2r19p3 03-Jan-07   EAC  Added comments/doc associated with changes from v2r19p1 below
 v2r19p2 19-Dec-06   LSR  Remove the 2 GCR tools from the default list and update 
                            and from _load.cxx. Update documentation a bit.

 v2r19   07-Dec-06   EAC  Added Enterance point of MC particle into ACD, also largest active dist to

 v2r18p3 07-Nov-06   LSR  Move Cal[X/Y]PosRmsLL calc, so it doesn't require a TKR track
 v2r18p2 03-Nov-06   LSR  Protect sqrt in CalValsTool.. will this fix Tom's problem?
 v2r18p1 02-Nov-06   LSR  Cleanup in CalValsTool--removed some hard-coded numbers
 v2r18   27-Oct-06   LSR  Added McSourceName to the ntuple

 v2r15p9 15-Oct-06   LSR  New CalValsTool vars: Cal[X/Y]PosRmsLL
                          Energy-weighted position rms in the last layer (layer 7)
                            For upgoing debris
 v2r15p8 24-Sep-06   LSR  Add character array to the supported Root datatypes
                          I don't have getVal() working for this type yet, but 
                             it can be written out. Don't write out a null string; Root
                             doesn't like it!
                          Arrays of character arrays are not supported in Root

                                We need to deal with bad ToT's further upstream. They
                                Are caused by bad gain calibrations
                              Fix counting for Tkr1ToTAsym & Tkr1ChisqAsym 
 v2r15p3 26-Jun-06   LSR  revert interface to previous version; change was unnecessary and confusing
 v2r15p2 25-Jun-06   LSR  add ability to write and access Root arrays, e.g. Tkr1Dir[3]
                              Error recovery needs more work (for now, don't make errors!)

                             that merit needs to be rebuilt
                          Add new variables from Bill to TkrValsTool and CalValsTool
                          Fix sourceId and charge for heavy ions
 v2r10p2 02-Mar-05   LSR  Connect debug flags to properties in AnalysisNtupleAlg...

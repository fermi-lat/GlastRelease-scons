/** @page anatup_vars 
@section tkrvalstool TkrValsTool Variables

Notes: 
- Variables called Tkr1Xxx refer to the "best" track; 
those called Tkr2Xxx refer to the second track.
- A number of variables have the word "Hits" in their name. This <em>usually</em>
refers to clusters! In some cases it refers to TkrTrackHits. 
The description should make it clear which meaning is intended.
- For variables listed as Tkr[1/2]Xxx there are two versions in the ntuple, 
one for the best and one for the second track. 
- The labels are not entirely consistent, but it's probably 
too disruptive to fix them at this point.
For example: TkrRadLength, TkrTrackLength, TkrTwrEdge refer to track 1. 
Also, Tkr2Angle and Tkr2HDoca are quantities that depend on both tracks.
- The variables associated with the second track are undefined 
if there is only one track! 
Check TkrNumTracks before using these variables! 
In fact check TkrNumTracks before using first-track variables, 
for the same reason.
- A new section of (optional) ssd-veto diagnostic variables has been added. 
They are not written out by default.
- Several new variables starting with "TkrV" have been added. These refer to 
quantities associated with the track likely to have cause the Acd veto.
- Some deleted variables, all Tkr2: FirstHits, DifHits, Gaps, FirstGaps,
DieEdge, KalThetaMs, [X/Y/Z]Dir, Phi, Theta, [X/Y/Z]0.

zero scattering angle, which would lead to infinite energy, 
the minimum measureable angle, which limits the energy to reasonable values

exiting the bottom, with a wide cluster in the last layer
<tr><td> Tkr[1/2]ConEne

The tool computes the total event energy and then partitions it 
between the first 2 tracks according to their Kalman energies 
and energy errors

<tr><td> Tkr1TwrGap  
<td>F<td>   Length of track in nominal intertower gap, currently set to 18 mm.

<tr><td> Tkr1SSDVeto  
<td>F<td>   New version of the SSD Veto. For this variable, tracks which pass close
to a dead plane, buffer-saturated region, inter-wafer gap, gap between towers,
or dead strips, do not cause the veto count to be incremented if no cluster is found.
This almost certainly overdoes it: a more correct calculation would include
the probability for the track to cross the inactive region. (Coming soon!)
<tr><td> TkrVetoPlaneCrossed
<td>I<td>   Number of planes contributiong to the SSD Veto. This doesn't count the points
where a track crosses in a gap.
<tr><td> Tkr1CoreHC
<td>F<td>   Number of clusters within a roughly cylindrical region )(default radius 10 mm) 
around the TrackHits in each plane between the first and last on the best
track, excluding the clusters that belong to the track itself
<tr><td> TkrDispersion
<td>F<td>   the RMS of the distances between the 1st track and all others in the event.
For tracks which start "above" the first track distance is the 3-D distance
For the rest, distance is the doca of the head of the track to the axis of
the first track.
<tr><td> TkrUpstreamHC
<td>F<td>   The number of clusters in a cylinder (default radius 150 mm) up to 4 layers thick
above the head of the first track.
<tr><td> Tkr1CORERatio
<td>F<td>   the ratio of Tkr1CoreHC and Tkr1Hits
<tr><td> Tkr1LATEdge
<td>F<td>   Minimum distance to any LAT edge of the head of the best track
<tr><td> Tkr1FirstHits  
<td>F<td>   Number of initial TrackHits used to determine the starting direction  
<tr><td> Tkr1DifHits  
<td>F<td>   Difference between the number of x and y clusters associated with track  
<tr><td> Tkr1GhostFrac
<td>F<td>   Fraction of good hits on track 1 that are ghosts
<tr><td> Tkr1ToT255Frac
<td>F<td>   Fraction of good hits on track 1 that have ToT==255
<tr><td> Tkr1SaturatedFrac
<td>F<td>   Fraction of good hits on track 1 that are saturated
<tr><td> Tkr1WideFrac
<td>F<td>   Fraction of good hits on track 1 whose with is >= m_minWide (default=5)
<tr><td> Tkr1WiderFrac
<td>F<td>   Fraction of good hits on track 1 whose with is >= m_minWider (default=9)
<tr><td> Tkr1Gaps  
<td>F<td>   Total number of gaps in track  
<tr><td> Tkr1FirstGaps  
<td>F<td>   Number of gaps in first Tkr1FirstHits layers on track  
<tr><td> Tkr1DieEdge  
<td>F<td>   Distance from die (wafer) edge of initial point 
(0 is halfway between the dies, increases toward center of die)  
<tr><td> Tkr1KalThetaMS  
<td>F<td>   Multiple scattering angle (radians) referenced to first layer. 
The contributions from all the layers in the track are adjusted 
for the predicted energy in each layer, and weighted accordingly. 
So the result is sensitive to the particle type and 
the chosen energy-loss mechanism.       
<tr><td> Tkr1[X/Y/Z]Dir  
<td>F<td>   Track [x/y/z] direction cosine  
<tr><td> Tkr1Phi  
<td>F<td>   Track phi, radians 
(direction from which particle comes, not particle direction!) 
range: (0, 2pi)  
<tr><td> Tkr1Theta  
<td>F<td>   Track theta, radians (direction ditto)  
<tr><td> Tkr1[X/Y/Z]0  
<td>F<td>   Track [x/y/z] position at first hit

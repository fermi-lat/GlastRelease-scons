@section intro Introduction

The variables from the Analysis Ntuple are presented here grouped by tool. 
Within each tool, variables are arranged roughly according to their position in the ntuple.

Unless otherwise noted, energy is in MeV, length is in mm, and angle is in radians. 
Also, unless otherwised noted, the null value, that is, the value in the ntuple when 
there is no calculated value for a given variable, is zero.


The variables may be of type <b>I</b>nt, <b>U</b>nsigned int, <b>F</b>loat, or <b>D</b>ouble. 
Currently, for reasons of history, most are floats, even those that take only integer values.

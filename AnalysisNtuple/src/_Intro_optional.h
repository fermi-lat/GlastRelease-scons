@section Introduction

Listed below are the variables produced by the ValsTools which are not part of the official merit ntuple, but which may be invoked by adding their names to the tool list.

The variables are grouped by tool. 
Within each tool, variables are arranged roughly according to their position in the ntuple.

Unless otherwise noted, energy is in MeV, length is in mm, and angle is in radians. 
Also, unless otherwised noted, the null value, that is, the value in the ntuple when 
there is no calculated value for a given variable, is zero.

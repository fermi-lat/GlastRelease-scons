/** @mainpage package AnalysisNtuple
 *
 * @author Leon Rochester
 *
 * @section description Description
 * The package contains a set of tools and an algorithm that runs them
 * to produce a comprehensive ntuple of recon results. The tools,
 * which can be invoked independently from the algorithm, also
 * allow access to all of the calculated variables.
 *
 *
 * @section jobOptions jobOptions
 * 
 * @param AnalysisNtupleAlg.tupleName 
 * Sets the name of the ntuple. (Default is "".) Must be the one opened by NTupleWriteSvc,
 * but there's no way for the code to find out what that is.  The name for
 * a standard GLEAM job is "GLEAM".
 * @param AnalysisNtupleAlg.tuple_name
 * An alternate spelling, to match the one used by NTupleWriterSvc.

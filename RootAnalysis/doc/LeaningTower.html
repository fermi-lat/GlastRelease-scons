<h1>Data Taking</h1>

<p>
Ultimately, we will have one full tower, consisting of 36 silicon planes.
However, initially we get data from single planes.
Thus, we have to adapt all possibilities.
Furthermore, the id of a plane depends on which read-out cable is being attached.
E.g., we can have data for plane X9 only, which means it is the 10<sup>th</sup> X plane (counted from back).
One could think of enforcing that always the same cable will be used,
but it is not completely under our control, as data are taken also and G&amp;E.
</p>

<p>
Thus, our proposal is to always to use the one-full-tower geometry, i.e. in job options:
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">
GlastDetSvc.xmlfile = "$(XMLGEODBSROOT)/xml/latAssembly/1TowerSegVols.xml";
</pre>
E.g., digi and clusters could be correlated.
Digi are counted from back, clusters from front.
E.g., a digi in layer <em>q</em> has corresponding clusters in <em>numLayers - 1 - q</em>.
</p>

<p>
Another point.
Data come in pairs, i.e. there is a ldf file, and a fits file.
I haven't understood what the fits file is good for, and even had problems in converting it.
</p>

<h1>Data File Validation</h1>

Out extlib collection contains a file to do that, $GLAST_EXT/LDF/v05-.../lib/Linux-g++/ldfDump.exe .

<h1>Making digi and recon</h1>

There are two packages in EngineeringModel, which are tuned for doing all the necessary conversions for two
mini tower geometries, Em1 and Em2.
I hesitate to create, just for this purpose, an extra package.
Instead, I use Em2, and just modify the job options files to my need.

<h2>Making the digi</h2>

I use $(EM2ROOT)/src/ldf2digi.txt.
Though a GlastDetSvc.xmlfile entry is there, is seems to be obsolete, i.e. I commented it.
Converting a fits file, I always got an empty digi file.
Hence, I convert the ldf file.
One has to change the following entries:
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">
digiRootWriterAlg.digiRootFile = "/glast/data/InT/TrayData/MCM260_digi.root";
EventSelector.StorageType = "LDFFILE";
EventSelector.InputList = { "/glast/data/InT/TrayData/MCM260.ldf" };
</pre>

<h2>Making the recon</h2>

I use $(EM2ROOT)/src/readigi_runrecon.txt.
One has to change the following entries:
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">
GlastDetSvc.xmlfile = "$(XMLGEODBSROOT)/xml/latAssembly/1TowerSegVols.xml";
digiRootReaderAlg.digiRootFile   = "/glast/data/InT/TrayData/MCM260_digi.root";
reconRootWriterAlg.reconRootFile = "/glast/data/InT/TrayData/MCM260_recon.root";
</pre>
One point to mention, if you take another job options file a template.
Because one single plane isn't able to produce a three-in-a-row trigger, obviously
the trigger mask has to be set to 0.
This is done by default in the job options file mentioned above.

<h1>Analyzing</h1>

<p>
We first used RootTreeAnalysis, but in interactive use it was to slow.
Also, it was not really practical to work with, for the obvious reasons
(define histogram dimensions before seeing data, no chance to zoom, retuning cuts etc.).
Thus, we decided to define a set of <a href="http://glast.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb/RootAnalysis/src/LeaningTower/TreeMaker.cxx?cvsroot=CVS_SLAC&f=h">useful</a>
parameters (click annotate, and go to lines 670ff, for rev 1.1).
These are read from the digi and recon files, and being filled into a tree.
</p>
<p>
This tree, much more compact than the original two files, can be easily analyzed by scripts.
The obvious drawback, if some parameters are missing, the tree has to be rebuild.
However, it's compiled code, thus sufficiently fast.
</p>
<p>
These tools and scripts are being stored in $(ROOTANALYSIS)/src/LeaningTower.

<h2>TreeMaker</h2>

This class is being used for making the tree.
For the moment, the history as RootTreeAnalysis is apparent.
I.e., the standard histograms are being created, and the mc root file is still being searched for.
For the moment, a command line call would be:
<pre style="margin-left: 80px;">
rh9_gcc32/runTreeMaker.exe digi.root recon.root ""
</pre>
The tree will be written to ./MyRootFile.root.

<h2>PlotMacros.C</h2>

Could also need some refinement.
For the moment, it collects two types of functions:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://glast.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb/RootAnalysis/src/LeaningTower/PlotMacros.C?cvsroot=CVS_SLAC&f=h">macros</a>
    <ul>
      <li>plot predefined histograms.  Cuts can be specified as parameters</li>
      <li>plots a list of events surviving a condition</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>a function
    <a href="http://glast.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/cvsweb/RootAnalysis/src/LeaningTower/PlotMacros.C?cvsroot=CVS_SLAC&f=h">Analyze()</a>
    which:
    <ul>
      <li>makes hit map histograms</li>
      <li>makes profile histograms of hit maps</li>
      <li>analyzes the hit maps and flags strips as dead or hot based on certain criteria</li>
      <li>does a linear regression of the cluster positions of the first track and prints the residuals</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

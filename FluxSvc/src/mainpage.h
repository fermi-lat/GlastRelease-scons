 \section intro Introduction
  This package implements the Gaudi objects:
  
  - FluxSvc: mangages (using the package flux) the sources. Also implements the Runnable interface
  - FluxAlg: generates the current incoming particl
  - ExposureAlg: if a Clock (or "TimeTick") pseudo-particle was geneated, puts the info into the exposure history
  - PointInfoAlg; Manages calculation of position and orientation entries in the "merit" tuple, with an entry per
  event, and the pointing info tuple, fed by ExposureAlg.
  <br>
<br>
Usage is primarily via the FluxAlg algorithm, which access the service to generate a particle and place it in the TDS.

  @section fluxsvc_jobOptions FluxSvc jobOptions
    @param FluxSvc.source_lib   [\$(FLUXSVCROOT)/xml/source_library.xml] list of file names containing source_lib elements
    @param FluxSvc.dtd_file     [\$(FLUXSVCROOT)/xml/source.dtd]  DTD file used to parse the XML files 
    @param FluxSvc.EvtMax       [0]  If non-zero, used as a maximum in the FluxSvc loop
    @param FluxSvc.StartTimeEnvVar [""] If set (e.g., to "runName") use this as the source of the start time.
    It has two forms: a number, or optionally a number for the start time offset, followed by a comma ant the delta time
    @param FluxSvc.StartTime    [0]  Mission elapsed time start
    @param FluxSvc.EndTime      [0]  Mission elapsed time end--if non-zero, will be the end.
    @param FluxSvc.DeltaTime    [0]  Maximum elapsed time.
    @param FluxSvc.StartDate    [""] Date, in form "2004-07-25 18:00" 
    note that if both StartDate and StartTime are specified, the latter is added to form the actual start
    @param FluxSvc.SampleInterval [1.0] Governs the minimum time that must elapse before a the GPS observers
    are notified to update pointing and attitude information.

  @section fluxalg_jobOptions FluxAlg jobOptions
    @param FluxAlg.source_name  ["default"] source name, name must be in the source_lib files
    @param FluxAlg.sources      [{}] if used, can specify multiple sources. Overrides source_name
    @param FluxAlg.MCrun        [100] Initial run number
    @param FluxAlg.area         [6.0] target area in m^2
    @param FluxAlg.backoff      [2.0] backoff distance in m
    @param FluxAlg.rocking_angle [0 deg] Rotation angle for Glast, about E-W axis. If set, so to 35 degress, and 
    there is no pointing history file, the mode will be to use the interal orbit description, with 
    rocking on alternate orbits. 
    @param FluxAlg.alignment    [{}] Set three rotation angles to mis-align GLAST
    @param FluxAlg.pointingDirection [{}] Set (ra,dec) for pointed mode. Other rocking stuff ignored.
    @param FluxAlg.AvoidSAA     [false] set true to skip events during SAA interval
    @param FluxAlg.zenithTheta  [-99] if overridden, set to this angle in local zenith frame

  @section exposurealg_jobOptions ExposureAlg jobOptions
    @param ExposureAlg.root_tree ["pointing_history"] name for the root tree to be filled if there are clock ticks
    @param ExposureAlg.PrintFrequency [1] number of INFO entries to create per tick
    @param ExposureAlg.clockName ["clock"]  The source name that will trigger entries

  @section PointInfoAlg_jobOptions PointInfoAlg jobOptions
    @param PointInfoAlg.pointing_info_tree_name ["MeritTuple"]If set, copy "Pt" values to it. See point_info for definitions.
    aparam PointInfoAlg.save_pointing_info  [false] Set true to save all entries in the pointing tuple. Normally saved by merit.

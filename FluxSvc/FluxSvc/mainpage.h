/*! \mainpage package FluxSvc

  This package implements a Gaudi service, encapsulating the flux package. Its only
  function is to return an IFlux object, whose methods are implemented by the flux package.
  <br>
  the file /src/test/jobOptions.txt holds information used for the implementation of FluxSvc.
  it also holds the standard set of strings representing xml filenames, thus allowing multiple 
  xml files to be used.
